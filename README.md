# Infinite download

> A web server that serves files that are infinite in size.

:warning: Be careful **not to save** the downloaded file or it will fill your hard drive.

*This little script was inspired by Mattias Geniar's [The Infinite File Download](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar/the-infinite-file-download).*

## How to use

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 bonnetn/infinite_download
```
